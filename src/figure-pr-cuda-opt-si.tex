  \caption{\textbf{Left:} Relative GM of time taken on all graphs for switched thread/block-per-vertex CUDA-based (GPU) static PageRank computation with the following algorithmic optimizations: no optimization (default), split vertices by components (split), and split vertices by components with each component sorted in topological order of its block-graph  (split+sort). This is relative to no optimization, with min. compute size ranging from 1 to 5Ã—107. \textbf{Right:} Rel. time taken for switched thread/block-per-vertex CUDA-based (GPU) static PageRank computation with the following algorithmic optimizations: no optimization (default), skip all in-identicals (skip2), and skip in-identicals of best min. size  (skipbest). The ratio is obtained with respect to no optimization. This is done on 5 web graphs, 4 social networks, 4 collaboration networks, and 4 road networks.}
