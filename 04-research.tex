I have worked on fast algorithms for community detection in large graphs. They minimize the use of shared data structures, and use stupidly simple, but amazingly fast hashtables.

Well, i don't lose hope from failures and "exceptions" - keep on learning. I was nearing the end of my fifth year as a PhD student. Our conference papers (2) got rejected 2-3 times.

The comments range from:
- Exaggerated fault rates
- Algorithms appear inefficient
- Confusion in fault-tolerance claims, race conditions, convergence, and algorithms
- Given limited insight on relationship of network topology with the results
- Lack of experimental results with realistic batch updates, overhead of FT
- Limited scope of results, lack of clarity on what is new, confusion in terminology

Just submitted both once again.

I like working with computer systems and improving their performance - and also in my workflow.

Research scholars in our group spent a lot of time running experiments - most of which is simply spent in loading datsets into memory. I don't just focus on optimizing my target problem, but also the infrastructure needed to support the experiments - faster graph loading, faster graph processing algorithms, and scripts to process output logs.
