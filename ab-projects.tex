\subsection{Independent Projects}

During my research work (2021-23), I develop a \href{https://github.com/nodef/nvgraph.sh}{CLI for nvGraph} - a GPU-based graph analytics library by NVIDIA, using CUDA; and a \href{https://github.com/nodef/snap-data.sh}{CLI for SNAP dataset} - a collection of more than 50 large networks. To minimize manual work, I write scripts to \href{https://github.com/javascriptf/script-minify-bibtex}{Shorten author, editor, journal, and booktitle in a BibTeX file}, another to \href{https://github.com/javascriptf/script-publications-list}{Get publications list from DBLP as a table in LaTeX or in BibTeX for references}, one to \href{https://github.com/javascriptf/script-gist-conceal}{Make a gist secret by creating a new secret gist, and deleting the old one}, and another to \href{https://github.com/javascriptf/script-git-sync-file}{Sync a file to a Git repository (such as GitHub Gist) periodically} in Node.js. For a short-term course on Distributed Systems, I design of a simple UDP/datagram based \href{https://github.com/javascriptf/nodejs-time-server}{NTP-like client and server} using Node.js to simulate the effect of transmission delays in a local, intra-continental, and inter-continental network.\ignore{In 2015-16, I design a few Windows applications. These include a \href{https://github.com/winp/timer}{Countdown timer} for Windows, a tool to \href{https://github.com/winp/text-hash}{Calculate an 8-bit hash of a given string using XOR+ROR method}, another to \href{https://github.com/winp/process-kill}{Terminate unnecessary/unused processes} in Windows, and one to \href{https://github.com/winp/website-ip}{Determine the IP address of a Website from its URL}.} I also write an \href{https://github.com/javascriptf/nodejs-4004-assembler}{Intel 4004 assembler} in Node.js that converts a plain assembly language file to binary.\ignore{While working at Verizon Hyderabad with Prashant Pathak, we develop a \href{https://github.com/raspberrypif/rfid}{Wireless RFID-based Snacks Ticketing System} using a Raspberry Pi with a Weigand based HID reader.}

\vspace{-3ex}
I also write and maintain a diverse range of Open source packages for Node.js. These include tools to \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-tunnel}{Tunnel web server from private IP}, perform automated trades with a \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-fyers}{Javascript interface for FYERS API}, get \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-quotes}{Insightful quotes on a topic}, and get \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-license}{SPDX License text}. In 2018-19, I note the release of Google's new WaveNet based Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine. I use this opportunity to write a tool that \href{https://github.com/nodef/wikipedia-tts}{Crawls Wikipedia pages and uploads TTS to YouTube}. These videos are available upon searching ``wikipedia audio article". To support this, I write tools to get \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-gcpconfig}{GCP}/\href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-awsconfig}{AWS} config, use long text with \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-googletts}{Google TTS}/\href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-amazontts}{Amazon Polly} through a \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-tts}{Common tool}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-ffmpeg}{Interface with FFMPEG}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-stillvideo}{Generate still video from an audio and image file}, \href{https://github.com/golangf/porjo--youtubeuploader}{Modify Ian Bishop's YouTube Uploader to handle captions}, and \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-youtubeuploader}{Interface with the modified YouTube uploader from Node.js}.

\vspace{-3ex}
In 2017-18, I use full-text search in PostgreSQL to build a hand-crafted \href{https://ifct2017.github.io}{Natural Language Query System for Indian Food Composition Tables 2017 (IFCT2017)}. IFCT2017 is published by T. Longvah, R. Ananthan, K. Bhaskarachary, and K. Venkaiah from National Institute of Nutrition (NIN). It contains detailed nutrient composition of 528 key foods in India. I use a PDF to Excel converter to read data in tables of each page, merge them together, fix conversion issues through manual checking, and convert it to CSV. Further, I adjust the units used for each nutrient to grams, and add additional relevant high-level columns. Finally I write a Node.js package to get \href{https://github.com/ifct2017/compositions}{Programmatic access to this Compositions data}. Data from a number of additional tables, including the compositions data, is available in the \href{https://github.com/ifct2017/ifct2017}{Main package}. To support natural language queries, I convert the \href{https://github.com/nodef/pg-english}{English language query to an informal SQL} first, perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) with \href{https://github.com/nodef/map-pg}{Promised Map interface for Table in PostgreSQL}, and then convert \href{https://github.com/nodef/pg-slang}{Informal SQL SELECT to formal SQL}. Testing required constant resetting and provisioning of new databases. For this, I write a script to \href{https://github.com/nodef/heroku-addonpool}{Manage Addon Pool of an App in Heroku}. I also prepare CLI tools to convert \href{https://github.com/nodef/food-e}{E numbers} and \href{https://github.com/nodef/food-ins}{INS numbers} of food additives to their respective full names.

\vspace{-3ex}
I also maintain collections of functions for in-built types in Node.js, such as, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-array}{Arrays}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-set}{Sets}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-map}{Maps}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-object}{Objects}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-iterable}{Iterables}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-entries}{Entries}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-lists}{Lists}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-ientries}{IEntries}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-ilists}{ILists}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-sorted-array}{Sorted Arrays}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-array-view}{Array Views}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-boolean}{Booleans}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-bit}{Bits}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-integer}{Integers}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-number}{Numbers}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-string}{Strings}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-bigint}{BigInts}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-function}{Functions}, and \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-async-function}{Async Functions}. In addition, I extend in-built modules, such as, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-fs}{File System (FS)}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-child-process}{Child Process}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-path}{Path}, and \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-math}{Math}. To support the automated building, testing, and documentation generation, I write and use a special \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-build}{Build tool} - this requires utilities for processing \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-javascript-text}{JavaScript}, \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-jsdoc-text}{JSDoc}, and \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-markdown-text}{Markdown} text. Building documentation for some packages requires the use of a \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-typedoc-theme}{Custom TypeDoc theme}. To generate ASCII videos of examples automatically, an \href{https://github.com/nodef/extra-asciinema}{Asciinema-based tool} can be used. To delete old/unused packages automatically, I write a tool to \href{https://github.com/javascriptf/devtools-delete-npm-org-packages}{Delete NPM packages in an organization} using Puppeteer. I originally conceived of maintaining Open source code as a potential business venture - which allows me to make passive money through donations. However, the market was already bustling with utility packages. Despite meticulous documentation and detailed list of functions, differentiation proved elusive.

Govindarajulu; I write a \href{https://github.com/vhdlf/cpu_basic}{turing-complete 32-bit CPU} in VHDL with data movement, branch, arithmetic, and logical instructions. It follows the instruction format of Intel x86 processors, where each instruction takes 2 register operands and an optional immediate value. Like x86, this has 16 32-bit registers, a flag register, and an instruction pointer. The memory address is made to be 16-bit for simulation purposes. A program running on the CPU (a simulation/testbench) was able to compute factorial of integers.

Here, two communicating processes $P$ and $Q$ send packets to each other, through a channel. $P$ is considered to be the main sending process, and $Q$ is sending acknowledgements. Each process has a send and a recieve buffer, and the channel is thought of as having $2$ buffers ($P \rightarrow Q$, $Q \rightarrow P$). We also submit assignments of \href{https://github.com/iiithf/software-foundations/blob/main/Assignments/Coq}{basic and induction based proofs} on Coq - an interactive theorem prover, and model \href{https://github.com/htmlf/merge-sort}{Merge sort as a multi-stage transition system} in Elm.

\subsection{Hobby Projects at St. Paul's School}

I first got into computer programming with LOGO in the 4th class. However, I take interest in programming when I learn about the \verb|IF| command in GWBASIC - the idea that computers are decision making machines! I took to learn BASIC in great detail - and eventually bump into graphics in GWBASIC itself. From Debashish, I pick up QuickBASIC 4.0, a brilliant programming environment by Microsoft. On the HP-Compaq desktop computer my father bought (with 256MB RAM and Windows XP installed), or the IBM Thinkpad laptop my father brought home after completing lab experiments, I pour in a lot of time on learning QuickBASIC and writing text/graphics mode DOS programs. My text mode programs include \href{https://github.com/qb40/file-sound}{Playing any file as a sound (frequency steps)}, designing a \href{https://github.com/qb40/file-pack}{4-bit Huffman coding based file packer}, performing \href{https://github.com/qb40/gravity-simulation}{Particle gravity simulation with velocity colored traces}, a simple \href{https://github.com/qb40/sound-creator}{Single tone sound creator}, \href{https://github.com/qb40/file-bytes}{Reading the bytes of a file one-by-one}, viewing the \href{https://github.com/qb40/file-graph}{byte values of a file as a line graph}, finding the \href{https://github.com/qb40/file-byte-sum}{Byte sum of a file to verify its integrity}, writing a tool for \href{https://github.com/qb40/file-encrypt}{Encrypting and decrypting a file}, a tool for helping \href{https://github.com/qb40/port-io-helper}{Find and verify IO ports}, another tool to determine the \href{https://github.com/qb40/keyboard-scancode}{Keyboard scancode of a key}, one for \href{https://github.com/qb40/text-draw}{Making a text-mode user interface or art}, a tool for finding basic \href{https://github.com/qb40/system-information}{System information}, a tiny \href{https://github.com/qb40/chocolate-info}{ASCII-art based chocolate info program}, and the classic \href{https://github.com/qb40/stone-paper-scissor}{Stone paper scissor game vs the CPU}.

QuickBASIC's \verb|SCREEN 13| VGA graphics mode is an 8-bit pixel (256 colors using palette) mode with $320\times200$ screen resolution. One can draw a pixel here by simply writing values to the $0xA000$ memory address (text mode is also similar, but speed is not an issue there). In this mode, I experiment with \href{https://github.com/qb40/3d-experiment}{3d formulae}, use \href{https://github.com/qb40/fun-with-mouse}{Left or right mouse button to draw}, design a small and simple \href{https://github.com/qb40/building-animation}{Animation showing rising building like structures}, a basic \href{https://github.com/qb40/ball-animation}{Bouncing ball animation}, demonstrate \href{https://github.com/qb40/designs}{50 different graphics animations}, develop a \href{https://github.com/qb40/picture-creator}{640x400 Picture creator tool}, and another to \href{https://github.com/qb40/image-effect}{Add an animated effect to an image}. I first learn assembly language with \verb|DEBUG32|, a command-line assembler and disassembler, and then move to \verb|MASM| and \verb|FASM| - I use these to write fast routines to draw to screen or perform mouse handling with Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs), with reference from Ralf Brown's Interrupt list. I also write a \href{https://github.com/qb40/boot-register-view}{Bootloader that shows the values of CPU registers} - which I tested using Bochs, a portable open source IA-32 (x86) PC emulator. Do these remind you of the Windows XP days? You can \href{https://github.com/themepackf/windows-xp}{download its theme} if you like.
